# RIDA Project BurnScar
## Project title: Temporal-based burnt scar profiling for modelling risk of forest fires in ASEAN countries
## Project Description:
1. Extension of the previous Newton project: a prototype of burnt scar detection in remote sensing images (periodically captured through a passive satellite by GISTDA and DoF: Department of Forestry).
2. Improve the performance of the previous detection model published, which focused on the explainable-AI-directed approach.
3. Aggregate the detection results over the temporal domain (e.g., years) to determine the risk of different areas.
4. The aggregated result/risk will be published via the online map platform (GISTDA: https://fire.gistda.or.th/dashboard.html and DoF: https://wildfire.forest.go.th/firemap/index.html) in conjunction with other analysis outcomes (e.g., hot spot report, land use, weather summary and prediction).
5. This porject funding by the United Kingdom Government

## Project Output:
1. The prototype of the burnt scar profiling system and associated libraries of programs implementing data loading, data pre-processing, burnt scar
detection, aggregation of temporal-based detection results, risk assessment and visualisation (as a spatial layer of measurement that complies with
the specification of GISTDA’s online map platform).
2. The prototype of a new method to improve the performance of the previous detection model, with a report of experiments on datasets purposefully
collected by GISTDA for this project.
3. The demonstration and assessment of GISTDA’s online map with the visualisation of risk metric obtained in (a), by experts of GISTDA, DoF and
representatives of other ASEAN countries. This is to be carried out using data and case studies specific to the scope of the study (covering northern
Thailand and areas of neighbouring countries).
4. Two technical workshops (at GISTDA and MFU) for other user organisations (governmental and industrial), community representatives, researchers,
and the public. These will promote the applicability of this system as well as the dissemination of knowledge and tools within the community of
practice.
5. Publication of the techniques and system developed in this project: one draft of a journal article and another draft for an international conference
presentation.
## Project Scope:
- Area coverage: Northern Thailand and those nearby regions in the neighbouring countries (i.e., Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam)
- Images from Sentienl-2
## Duration: 
6 months

## Acknowledgements

Gratitude is extended to [axonapiwit](https://github.com/axonapiwit) for their excellent work on the [react-leaflet-project](https://github.com/axonapiwit/react-leaflet-project). Portions of the code, specifically related to the Leaflet map and AQI (Air Quality Index) implementation, have been utilized and further developed in this project. Their contributions have been invaluable to this work.
Thank you.
