```

### Data Preparation


![png]('material/flow.png')


'data_preparation' function is image processing which will resample satellite image(jp2) all range into 10m
and move into 'sentinel_process/Image' folder. And next step finction will call subprocess 'sentinel_process.py'.

'sentinel_process.py' is subprocess file which are contain function 'process_bands' it will use 'sentinel_process/Image'
folder for read raster from 'data_preparation' here is step of subprocess

 - Step 1 : check all raster are in 'sentinel_process/Image' 
 - Step 2 : generate water detect mask using waterdect library (concept and reference from Maur√≠cio Cordeiro)
 - Step 3 : process_bands function is read all raster and combine band and save into GeoTiff 
 - Step 4 : use water mask.tiff and combine.tiff merge together and which raster map to mask made value = 0
 - step 5 : save .tif to 'raster' folder for predict and modeling step
 

### Folder Structure

```




## Machine Learning
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.9
- rasterio: A library for reading and writing geospatial raster data. It provides tools to work with raster datasets and perform operations such as reading, writing, and processing raster files.
- numpy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and comes with a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures like Series and DataFrame for handling and analyzing structured data efficiently.
- pickle: A Python module used for serializing and de-serializing Python object structures, also called "pickling" and "unpickling". It is useful for saving Python objects to a file and loading them back.
- collections.Counter: A subclass of the dictionary that helps count hashable objects. It is an easy way to count occurrences of items.
- os: A module that provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system.
- geopandas: An extension of pandas that supports spatial data operations. It provides tools to work with geospatial data, including reading and writing shapefiles, GeoJSON, and other formats.
- shapely.geometry.shape: Part of the Shapely library, it is used to create geometric objects from GeoJSON-like dicts. It supports various geometric operations.
- scipy: A function in the SciPy library for image processing. It is used to label connected components in an array, which is useful for segmenting and analyzing images.
- reverse_geocoder: A library for performing reverse geocoding, which is the process of converting geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) into human-readable addresses.
- pycountry: A library that provides ISO country, subdivision, and currency definitions. It is useful for accessing standardized information about countries and regions.
- datetime: A module that supplies classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways.
- sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler: A part of the scikit-learn library used for feature scaling. MinMaxScaler transforms features by scaling them to a given range, usually between 0 and 1.
- logging: A module that provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs. It is useful for tracking events that happen during the execution of the program.
- ast: A module that helps Python applications process trees of the Python abstract syntax grammar. It can be used to safely evaluate or manipulate Python expressions.
- shapely.geometry.Polygon: Part of the Shapely library, it is used to create polygon geometric objects. It supports various geometric operations and manipulations.
